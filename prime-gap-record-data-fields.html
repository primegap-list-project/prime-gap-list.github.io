<div class="ui large header">A characterisation of the fields used to represent prime record gap data.</div>

<div class="ui medium header">1. <i>gapsize</i></div>

<p>This field contains the size or measure of the gap (difference of the bounding primes).</p>

<div class="ui medium header">2. <i>ismax</i></div>

<p>The gap is a MAXIMAL gap, strictly exceeding in measure all the prime gaps preceding it (those between consecutive prime numbers smaller in magnitude). In this case, it will in addition always be a definite first occurrence and certified.</p>

<div class="ui medium header">3. <i>primecat</i></div>

<p>This field indicates the type of the gap. All of the gaps in this list are “conventional” (common, classic, standard, regular, ordinary, normal) prime gaps, indicated by the letter “C”; in other words, consecutive prime numbers differing by the measure of the gap, as defined by conditions (1) and (2) alone from the above definition of first occurrence prime gaps. This is the default; if the term “prime gap” is used without further qualification or elaboration, it refers to a conventional prime gap. Additional lists are planned, enumerating other types of prime gaps.</p>

<div class="ui medium header">4. <i>isfirst</i></div>

<p>This field indicates the first occurrence status of the prime gap.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The character “F” signifies that the gap has definitely been established (by an exhaustive scan to or beyond that point) as a first occurrence prime gap.</li>
    <li>The character “N” signifies that the gap is definitely not a first occurrence (a prior occurrence is known).</li>
    <li>The character “?” signifies that the gap is a first known occurrence (no such gap with smaller bounding primes has been found), but that it is not presently known if it is the first occurrence (i.e., whether or not a gap of equal measure with smaller bounding primes exists).</li>
</ul>

<p>All gaps presently in this list are first known occurrences not known (or expected) to be first occurrences; presumably, as the list evolves, entries will occasionally be replaced by newly discovered smaller instances of gaps.</p>

<div class="ui medium header">5. <i>primecert</i></div>

<p>This field indicates whether the bounding integers of the gap are certified primes (“C”) or probabilistic primes (“P”). The bounding integers of certified gaps (also titled confirmed, conclusive, deterministic, definite, definitive, or proven) have been conclusively proven prime, using trial prime divisors to the square root of the prime, or a test such as APRCL2 (Adleman-Pomerance-Rumely-Cohen-Lenstra-Lenstra).</p>

<p>The gap is probabilistic (also titled “Monte Carlo”) if the bounding integers have only been shown statistically prime (with a probability extremely close to one), using, for example, Miller’s test with multiple bases. For extremely large integers (hundreds or thousands of digits), probabilistic tests are orders of magnitude faster than deterministic tests, but nonetheless become time consuming in the thousands of digits.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I attempt to personally certify the smaller gaps (to perhaps 100 digits), and to verify probabilistically larger gaps (to perhaps 500 digits). For gaps with even larger initiating primes, I must rely on the discoverer’s report and the vigilance of third parties.<br/><i>Declaration by originator and maintainer Dr. Thomas R. Nicely</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In all cases, the interior integers of the gaps have been certified deterministically to be composite, using, for example, trial divisors, Fermat’s test, or Miller’s test.</p>

<div class="ui medium header">6. <i>discoverer</i></div>

<p>This field contains an abbreviation of the listed discoverers. A key of abbreviations to full names (and credit acknowledgements) is maintained separately.</p>

<div class="ui medium header">7. <i>year</i></div>

<p>This field reflects the most accurate value known for the actual date of discovery; if this is not known, the date of publication or the date of the preprint is shown; if this is not known, an estimate is given.</p>

<div class="ui medium header">8. <i>merit</i></div>

<p>This field states a so-called figure of merit for the gap. This indicates how much larger the gap is than the average gap (approximately ln(x), as a consequence of the Prime Number Theorem) between primes near that point; the greater the merit, the more unusual the gap. The merit is computed as <math>G/ln(p<sub>1</sub>)</math>; variations in use (and at one time employed in these tables) include <math>G/ln(p<sub>2</sub>)</math> and <math>G/ln((p<sub>1</sub> + p<sub>2</sub>)/2)</math>, where <math>p<sub>1</sub></math> and <math>p<sub>2</sub></math> are the initiating and terminating primes of the gap. For all but the first few gaps, the differences among these formulas are trivial; indeed, if the results are rounded to two decimal places (as herein), I (Dr. Thomas R. Nicely) have found no discrepancies in the resulting values for any gap exceeding <math>112</math>.</p>

<div class="ui medium header">9. <i>primedigits</i></div>

<p>This field indicates the number of decimal digits in the initiating prime.</p>

<div class="ui medium header">10. <i>primestart</i></div>

<p>This field shows the initiating prime (smaller bounding integer) of the gap.</p>

<p>Initiating primes longer than 200 decimal digits are subject to abbreviation, unless they can be represented by a simple formula (such as <math>10^999 + 7</math>). This unfortunate policy is implemented due primarily to a shortage of bandwidth. As the listing grows, additional restrictions of this type may become necessary, including bounds on gap sizes, figures of merit, or the size of the initiating primes.</p>

<p>If the complete expansion of an abbreviated prime is desired, I recommend that you contact the discoverer.</p>
