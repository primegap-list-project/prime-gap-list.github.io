            <p>Preserving part of the legacy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000820091337/http://www.trnicely.net/index.html">Dr. Thomas R. Nicely</a>, the original creator of the prime gap list and its subsequent curator for nearly 20 years until his death in a car accident on Sept 11th. 2019.. The University of Lynchburg published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191121205013/https://www.lynchburg.edu/news/2019/09/remembering-dr-thomas-nicely-legendary-teacher-who-discovered-pentium-bug/">an obituary</a></p>
            <p>The following rubric is taken from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191008221424/http://www.trnicely.net/gaps/gaplist.html"><tt>trnicely.net/gaps/gaplist.html</tt></a></p>

            <p>The measure of the gap is shown in positions 1-9, right justified using leading blanks.</p>

            <p>The classifications of the gaps are shown in positions 10-14. Position 10 is an asterisk for maximal gaps, otherwise a blank. Position 11 is always blank. Position 12 is (in this table) always a "C", indicating an ordinary or common prime gap. Position 13 is ordinarily a "?", indicating that the gap is a first known occurrence, but that it is not known whether or not it is a true first occurrence. This character would be an "F" if the gap had been proven a first occurrence, or an "N" if it had been proven not a first occurrence. Position 14 is a "P" if the bounding primes are probabilistic, or a "C" if the bounding primes have been certified deterministically.</p>

            <p>If position 14 is a "?" (classification code "C??"), the bounding integers are probable primes (primes or strong base-2 pseudoprimes), but the interior integers of the gap have not been verified all composite to the satisfaction of Thomas R. Nicely; consequently, there remains a significant possibility that such a gap may in fact be smaller in measure than indicated, due to the as yet undetected presence of an interior prime.</p>

            <p>Position 15 is blank.</p>

            <p>Positions 16-23 carry an eight-character abbreviation indicating the discoverer(s) of the gap, as provided in the accompanying key.</p>

            <p>Position 24 is blank.</p>

            <p>Positions 25-28 indicate the year of discovery. Position 29 is blank.</p>

            <p>Positions 30-37 indicate the merit of the gap, to four decimal places. Position 38 is blank.</p>

            <p>Positions 39-45 indicate the number of decimal digits in the initiating prime. Positions 46 and 47 are blank.</p>

            <p>The value of the initiating prime begins in position 48. This value must be specified in full in submissions, but for primes exceeding 200 digits or characters, the value shown in the table is truncated (some of the initiating primes exceed 100,000 decimal digits). Abbreviated primes are shown in the form 123456789012345678901234567890..., with a few (usually 25 or more) of the most significant digits shown, followed by an ellipsis "...".</p>

            <p>In gap submissions, the initiating prime must be specified in full. If a formula is available, it can presumably be expressed within the 200-character limit.</p>

            <p>If the prime is a literal integer, of course, it may contain many thousands of digits. In this event, it may all be written to a single record in the file, or it may be written using line continuation, with a trailing backslash "\" as the continuation character.</p>

            <p>The line continuation format used by the author employs 200 digits per line, occupying positions 48-247 inclusive, with the trailing backslash in position 248, and blanks in positions 1-47 of continuation lines (this matches the location of the prime's most significant 200 digits in the first line).</p>

            <p>This format is also to be used for gaps whose measure is less than 1000000, but whose initiating primes contain more than 99999 digits.</p>

            <p>The following table is believed to exhibit all first occurrence and maximal prime gaps conclusively established as of the date shown above.</p>
