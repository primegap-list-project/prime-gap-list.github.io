excerpt: "The upper bound exhaustive scans for orime gaps confirms Bertil Nymanâ€™s maximal primes"
---

As a result of the continuing extension of the upper bound of exhaustive scans for prime gaps, the first known occurrence prime gaps of 1530 and 1550, following respectively the primes 17678654157568189057 and 18361375334787046697, and discovered respectively 19 April 2014 and 13 July 2014 by the late Dr. Bertil Nyman, have now been confirmed (13 August 2018) as first occurrence prime gaps and maximal prime gaps. Nyman's maximal prime gap of 1550 is the largest maximal prime gap presently known.

The merit of Nyman's new maximal prime gap G=1550 is M=34.9439.
