excerpt:  A new largest gap of measure G=6582144 has been discovered by Martin Raab.
---

Martin Raab has discovered a new first (and largest) known occurrence prime gap of measure G=6582144 following the 216841-digit prime *P1=499973#/30030 - 4509212* (where 499973# indicates the product of all primes from 2 through 499973 inclusive).

This gap was first reported by Raab on 01 July 2017. The endpoints have passed the strong [BPSW test](http://www.trnicely.net/misc/bpsw.html) (Nicely, 04 September 2017) for probabilistic primality.

All the interior integers have been demonstrated composite (18 August 2017) by [ATH](https://www.mersenneforum.org/member.php?u=772) on the [Mersenne Forum](https://www.mersenneforum.org).

A test for deterministic certification of primality is at present out of the question. The gap has merit M=13.182884.
