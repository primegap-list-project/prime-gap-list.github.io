              The records reside in a sql script on Github. The schema is detailed in some length in

              The fields are fairly decriptive with the exception of "primecat", "primecert", "ismax", and "isfirst".
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>"ismax"</strong>
                  : is this gap a maximal gap (strictly exceeding in measure all the prime gaps preceding it)?
                  <br>
                  Values: 1 and 0
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>"isfirst"</strong>
                  : is this the first gap of this size?
                  <br>
                  The character "F" signifies that the gap has definitely been established (by an exhaustive scan to or beyond that point) as a first occurrence prime gap.
                  <br>
                  Values: "F" and ""
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>"primecat"</strong>
                  : The categorization (or classification) of the prime gap
                  <br>
                  The character "C" signifies conventional (common, classic,  standard, regular, ordinary, normal) prime gaps.
                  <br>
                  At this time no other values are used.
                  <br>
                  Values: "C"
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>"primecert"</strong>
                  : The certification of the bounding integers of the gap.
                  <br>
                  The character "C" signifies certified primes (e.g. ECPP).
                  <br>
                  The character "P" signifies probabilistic primes.
                  <br>
                  The character "?" signifies the gap is unverified but taken from a

                  <br>
                  Values: "C" and "P"
